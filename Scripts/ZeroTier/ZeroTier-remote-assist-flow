# This first section is a the default drop rule set from ZeroTier. It allows IPv4 and IPv6 traffic but otherwise
# behaves like a standard Ethernet switch:

drop
	not ethertype ipv4
	and not ethertype arp
	and not ethertype ipv6
;

# ADMIN, allows access to all devices on the network
cap admin
  id 999
  accept;
  ;

# ARD, allows ARD access to a device with this assigned capability
cap ard
  id 11
  accept ethertype arp; # Allow ARP for device discovery
  accept ipprotocol tcp and dport 5900-5902; # Allow VNC ports
  accept ipprotocol udp and dport 5900-5902; # Allow VNC ports (UDP)
  accept ipprotocol udp and sport 5900-5902; # Allow return traffic
  ;

# RDP, allows RDP access to Windows devices with this assigned capability
cap rdp
  id 12
  accept ethertype arp; # Allow ARP for device discovery
  accept ipprotocol tcp and dport 3389; # Allow RDP port (TCP)
  accept ipprotocol udp and dport 3389; # Allow RDP port (UDP)
  accept ipprotocol udp and sport 3389; # Allow return traffic
  ;

# Accept anything else. This is required since default is 'drop':
